Synthetic Workflow Generators
=============================

This repository contains several synthetic workflow generators that can be used
to evaluate scheduling and provisioning algorithms for scientific workflow
management systems. These workflow generators are based on models of real
applications that have been parameterized with file size and task runtime data
from execution logs and publications that describe the workflows. If you use
this code to generate data that is used in a publication, please cite [1].
Please also cite the relevant publication for the workflows you use.

The 'bharathi' subdirectory contains a Java workflow generator that produces
synthetic workflows for the applications described in [2,3].

The 'juve' subdirectory contains a Python workflow generator that produces
synthetic workflows for the applications described in [4,5,6,7].
