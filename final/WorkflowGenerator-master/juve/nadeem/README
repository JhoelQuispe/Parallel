These synthetic workflows come from:

    Farrukh Nadeem, Thomas Fahringer, "Using Templates to Predict 
    Execution Time of Scientific Workflow Applications in the Grid", 
    9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and 
    the Grid, 2009.

None of the workflows have data specified, and the runtime distributions
for the tasks are not known. A simple uniform distribution between 1 and 100
seconds and a scaling parameter are used for the time being.
