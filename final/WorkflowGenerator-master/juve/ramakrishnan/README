This project contains workflow DAX generators for all of the workflows in 
the Ramakrishnan and Gannon report:

    L. Ramakrishnan and D. Gannon, "A Survey of Distributed Workflow 
    Characteristics and Resource Requirements", University of Indiana 
    Technical Report TR671, 2008.

The report can be downloaded here:

There are 15 workflows in total. The names of the workflows scripts are:
    avianflu.py
    cadsr.py
    floodplain.py
    gene2life.py
    glimmer.py
    leadadas.py
    leaddm.py
    leadmm.py
    mcstas.py
    mememast.py
    molsci.py
    motif.py
    psload.py
    psmerge.py
    scoop.py

To generate a workflow, simply run the script associated with the workflow.
For example, to generate the leaddm workflow run:

    python leaddm.py -D leaddm.xml

That will write the lead workflow into the leaddm.xml DAX file.

If you run a workflow script with a '-h' argument you will get a help message
that describes all the parameters.

There are 5 workflows that take parameters to specify the number of jobs.
These workflows are:

    scoop.py
    motif.py
    avianflu.py
    psload.py
    psmerge.py

Typically these workflows take a -N argument that defines a branching factor
in the workflow. Some of the parameterized workflows have ranges for 
generating random numbers of jobs. The other workflows have a fixed number of 
jobs.

The 'all.py' script generates the DAX files that are posted on the web page, 
along with some DOT scripts that were used to generate the figures on the
web page.
