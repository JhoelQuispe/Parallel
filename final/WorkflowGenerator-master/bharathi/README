This is a synthetic workflow generator that generates workflows based on real
applications or generic shapes.

The main classes are:

    simulation.generator.AppGenerator   - Generates application DAXes.
    simulation.generator.ShapeGenerator - Generates random DAXes with various
                                          shapes.
    simulation.generator.RunAll         - Generates application DAXes in several
                                          different sizes and writes them to
                                          files in the current directory.

The application DAXes supported are:

    CYBERSHAKE
    MONTAGE
    SIPHT
    LIGO
    GENOME

The workflows generated for these applications use statistical distributions of
file size, workflow structure, and runtime that were derived from real workflows
used by the application.

The code can be compiled using:

$ ant compile

There are wrapper scripts in the bin/ directory for each of the main classes.
For example, to run the AppGenerator, use:

$ ./bin/AppGenerator -h
